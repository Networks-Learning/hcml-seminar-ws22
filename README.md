# Human-Centric Machine Learning seminar (Winter 2022)

The Human-Centric Machine Learning seminar focuses on reading and presenting recent papers in human-centric machine learning, with a particular emphasis 
in societal aspects of machine learning (fairness, accountability, transparency), human-ai collaboration, strategic behavior and causality. The papers 
will cover both theoretical foundations as well as applications and empirical studies.

The seminar is open both for Bachelor and Master students.

## As a student

You will read a few papers in one topic in human-centric machine learning and present an overview of the topic. There will be several
possible topics to choose from (see below) and you can present alone or in small groups of 2-3 students. To help you with the presentation, an 
instructor will be assigned to you to supervise you and provide advice for your presentation.

The presentations will take place 3-4 different days throughout the Winter semester. As a student, you will need to attend all presentations and 
ask questions to the presenters. 

Important dates:

- Topic selection and name of presenters: 02.12.21
